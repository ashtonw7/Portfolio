This is my portfolio website built with Next.js and Tailwind! You can see a live version at [ashtonwinters.com](ashtonwinters.com).
The website is accessible, responsive, and features some fun doodles I made. Check out my other website too, [www.fatpuppet.com](fatpuppet.com).

Feel free to look at the code, but be warned--I need to clean up the readability some of Tailwind CSS. I love Tailwind for little sites like this though!

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
